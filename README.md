<h1 align="center">üï∏ Add GraphQL to Svelte</h1>

## ‚ùì What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add a GraphQL server (powered by [`graphql-helix`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/)) to your SvelteKit project.

## üõ† Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command. **You must say yes to TypeScript preprocessing.**
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up GraphQL:
```sh
npx svelte-add graphql-server
```

After the preset runs,
* You can create a GraphQL schema in `src/graphql/schema.ts` using any library or technique you want. Additionally, you can set the `defaultQuery` that shows up when GraphiQL is loaded in the browser.

* You can query your API (with POST requests) at the `/graphql` endpoint.

* You can visit GraphiQL in the browser at the `/graphql` endpoint.

* You can see an example of how you may set up resolver-level authorization with the `contextFactory` line in `src/routes/graphql.ts` and the `authorization` argument in `src/graphql/schema.ts`.

* The `/` route (in your `src/routes/index.svelte` file) will show an example of how to use your GraphQL API in `preload`.

* You [*cannot* use GraphQL subscriptions](https://github.com/svelte-add/graphql/issues/1).

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality.
